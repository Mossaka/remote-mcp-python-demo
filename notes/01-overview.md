# Demo Overview

This demo will show you how to build a remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server from scratch in 15 minutes, starting with a simple hello world and evolving it into a fully functional todo management server accessible over HTTP. We'll follow an incremental approach to demonstrate the core concepts of MCP server development.
